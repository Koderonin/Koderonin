- 😏 Always looking to improve the quality of my code!
- 💬 Ask me about *anything*. The answer may not be right, but we'll laugh about it!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a spider pet in my room who feeds on mosquitoes and other pests. Its name is Alex!

- 👨‍🏫 I love to help people and share my time and knowledge with people avid to learn :)
